**Status**: Draft | Validated | Re-validated

## Authority Map

Authority patterns suggested by domain profile: [list from domain profile, or "none — first engagement in this domain"]

| # | Authority | Scope | Consumers | Constraints | Evidence |
|---|----------|-------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | [What truth does this authority own?] | [What decisions/data does this authority cover?] | [Who depends on this truth?] | [What rules govern this authority?] | [OBSERVED] / [INFERRED] / [ASSUMED] |

**Note**: Authority categories are domain-specific. Examples:
- Healthcare: Clinical source of record, Consent authority, Formulary authority
- Payments: Transaction source of truth, Reconciliation authority, Release governance
- Logistics: Fleet state authority, Route optimization authority, Delivery confirmation authority
- ML/AI: Training data lineage, Model registry authority, Serving configuration authority

## Document Classification

| # | Document | Type | Classification | Rationale |
|---|----------|------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | [Document name] | PRD / HLD / Adjacent HLD / Scope Statement / Glossary | Canonical / Directional | [Why this classification] |

**Canonical** — authoritative, changes require formal approval
**Directional** — informative, may evolve without formal gate

## Authority Conflicts (if any)

| # | Conflict | Domain A Claims | Domain B Claims | Resolution | Status |
|---|----------|----------------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | [What is contested] | [Domain A's claim] | [Domain B's claim] | [How resolved or who to escalate to] | Resolved / Open |

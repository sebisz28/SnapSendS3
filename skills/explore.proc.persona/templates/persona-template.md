## AGENT USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

This document is designed to be read and used by a downstream AI agent.

- Reference personas by ID (e.g., `persona_id: P1`)
- `[VALIDATED]` = confirmed from human-provided input. Safe to use in downstream artifacts.
- `[ASSUMPTION]` = agent-inferred. Must be validated with real user research before use
  in strategic decisions, journey maps, or user flows.
- Do not treat `[ASSUMPTION]` fields as facts. Surface them as hypotheses.
- The "Assumptions to Validate" section per persona lists the highest-priority items needing research.
- **Validation priority** in the summary table = High if >50% of fields are assumptions;
  Medium if 25–50%; Low if <25%.

# Step 1: Map System Context

## Objective

Document existing platforms, dependencies, integrations, technology stack, and deployment context.

## Entry Criteria

- [ ] Context baseline available
- [ ] System context known or stakeholder input available
- [ ] Slug confirmed

## Actions

### 1.1 Document Existing Platforms

For each platform:
- Name, purpose, version, status (Active/Legacy/Deprecated)
- Owner and constraints

### 1.2 Document Dependencies

For each dependency:
- Name, purpose, version, criticality
- Update frequency and constraints

### 1.3 Map Integrations

For each system we must connect to:
- Purpose, integration method (REST/GraphQL/MQ/etc.)
- Data flow (inbound/outbound/bidirectional)
- Owner, SLA, constraints

### 1.4 Document Technology Stack

- Frontend (framework, language, state management, styling, build tools)
- Backend (language, framework, API style, authentication)
- Database (primary, caching, search)
- Infrastructure (hosting, containers, CI/CD, monitoring)

### 1.5 Document Deployment Context

- Environments (dev, staging, production)
- Deployment process (frequency, approval, rollback, downtime)
- Infrastructure constraints

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Existing platforms documented
- [ ] Dependencies listed with criticality
- [ ] Integrations mapped with methods and SLAs
- [ ] Technology stack documented
- [ ] Deployment context described

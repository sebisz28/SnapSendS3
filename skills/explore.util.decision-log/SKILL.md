# Decision Log

Maintain a running log of architectural decisions with alternatives considered, rationale, and ownership throughout an HLD engagement.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:

- Track every architectural decision made during an HLD engagement
- Record alternatives considered and rationale for each selection
- Document who drove each decision (architect or agent recommendation)
- Flag decision reversals with links to the original entry
- Maintain an audit trail for future design reviews and onboarding
- Provide traceability from decisions to the artifacts they affect

**Processes that use this skill**:
- Architecture Copilot (Steps 1–4: all steps — loaded eagerly at Step 1, persists through engagement)

**Key principle**: Decisions are first-class artifacts. Every decision must be traceable to who made it, why, and what alternatives were rejected.

## Inputs to Request

Before initializing a decision log, ensure you have:

1. **HLD name** — the name of the HLD engagement for the log header
2. **Engagement start date** — for the first entry timestamp
3. **Slug** — project identifier for file naming (e.g., `payments-reconciliation`)

**STOP**: If the HLD name or slug is not confirmed, request it from the architect before proceeding.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Initialize the Decision Log

Create the decision log file at the start of the engagement.

```
Decision Log Initialized

File: explore/hlds/[slug]-decision-log.md
HLD: [HLD Name]
Engagement start: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Total decisions: 0

The decision log is now active. Every substantive decision from this point forward will be recorded.

How would you like to proceed?
- Confirm — decision log is ready
- Adjust — change the HLD name or slug
```

**STOP**: Wait for architect to confirm the decision log is initialized correctly.

### Step 2: Record a Decision

After every substantive interaction where a decision is made, add an entry using this format.

```
Decision Recorded: DEC-[NNN]

Decision: [Short title]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Step: [Which step this occurred in]
Driver: Architect / Agent recommendation

What was decided:
[Description of the decision]

Why this option was chosen:
[Rationale]

Alternatives rejected:
- [Option A] — rejected because [reason]
- [Option B] — rejected because [reason]

Evidence level: [VALIDATED] / [ASSUMPTION]
Impact: [What this affects downstream]
Status: Active

Running total: [N] decisions ([N] active, [N] reversed, [N] superseded)
```

**STOP**: No explicit stop — this step runs continuously after every substantive interaction.

### Step 3: Record a Reversal

If a previously accepted decision is revisited or reversed, create a new entry that links to the original.

```
Decision Reversal: DEC-[NNN] reverses DEC-[MMM]

Original decision (DEC-[MMM]): [Short title of original]
Original date: [Date]
Original driver: [Architect / Agent]

New decision: [What is now decided]
Reversal reason: [Why the original decision was overturned]
Triggered by: [What feedback, finding, or new context caused this]
Impact: [What downstream artifacts or decisions are affected]

⚠️ Downstream items to update:
- [Artifact or decision affected]
- [Artifact or decision affected]

DEC-[MMM] status updated to: Reversed (see DEC-[NNN])

How would you like to proceed?
- Confirm reversal — update all downstream references
- Reconsider — keep original decision, discard reversal
- Partial reversal — modify only [specific aspect]
```

**STOP**: Wait for architect to confirm the reversal before updating downstream references.

### Step 4: Mid-Engagement Summary

At the end of each step, produce a decision log summary for the architect.

```
Decision Log Summary — End of Step [N]

| # | Decision | Driver | Status | Evidence |
|---|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| DEC-001 | [Short title] | Architect / Agent | Active / Reversed | [VALIDATED] / [ASSUMPTION] |
| DEC-002 | [Short title] | Architect / Agent | Active / Reversed | [VALIDATED] / [ASSUMPTION] |

Total decisions: [N]
Active: [N] | Reversed: [N] | Superseded: [N]
Architect-driven: [N] | Agent-recommended: [N]
Assumption-based: [N] (these carry validation risk)

How would you like to proceed?
- All accurate — proceed to next step
- Correct an entry — tell me which decision and what to change
- Add missing decision — I made a decision that wasn't logged
```

**STOP**: Wait for architect to validate the decision log summary before proceeding to the next step.

### Step 5: Finalize Decision Log

At engagement completion, run the validation checklist and produce the final version.

**Validation checklist:**

- [ ] Every major architectural decision has an entry
- [ ] Every entry has: what, when, why, alternatives rejected, driver
- [ ] Every reversal links to the original entry with reason
- [ ] Evidence tags ([VALIDATED] / [ASSUMPTION]) on every entry
- [ ] No orphaned references (reversed decisions updated in downstream artifacts)
- [ ] Decision index matches detail section (no missing or extra entries)
- [ ] Status field is current for every entry (Active / Reversed / Superseded)
- [ ] File written to correct path with correct slug

```
Decision Log Complete

File: explore/hlds/[slug]-decision-log.md
Total decisions: [N]
Active: [N] | Reversed: [N] | Superseded: [N]
Architect-driven: [N] | Agent-recommended: [N]
Assumption-based decisions: [N]
Validation: [N] of 8 checks passed ✓

Ready for handoff as companion document to final HLD.
```

**STOP**: Wait for architect to confirm the decision log is finalized.

## Output Format

```
explore/hlds/[slug]-decision-log.md
```

**Template**: `templates/decision-log.md`

1. **Header** — HLD name, engagement start date, last updated date, total decisions count
2. **Decision Index** — summary table with #, date, step, decision title, driver, status
3. **Decision Details** — each entry (DEC-NNN) with date, step, driver, decision, rationale, alternatives rejected, evidence level, impact, status
4. **Reversals** — reversal entries with link to original, reason, triggered by, downstream impact

## Integration with Workflows

Architecture Copilot loads this skill eagerly before Step 1 begins. It persists across all 4 steps of the engagement and is one of the 4 final deliverables in the handoff package. Every other skill in the process feeds decisions into this log.

**Integrates with**:
- **Boundary Mapping** — feeds truth hierarchy and ownership decisions as initial entries
- **Design Sketch** — feeds architect selections for decision points and calibration shifts
- **HLD Drafting** — feeds decisions made during draft generation
- **Feedback Integration** — feeds feedback dispositions and hardening findings
- **Socialization & Handoff** — feeds simplification selections as final entries
- **Blocker Register** — references decision entries when blockers are related to decisions

## Best Practices

**Do**:
- Record decisions immediately after each substantive interaction — never batch
- Distinguish architect-driven vs agent-recommended decisions explicitly
- Link every reversal to the original entry with a clear reason
- Tag evidence level on every entry — [VALIDATED] or [ASSUMPTION]
- List all rejected alternatives with reasons — not just the selected option
- Produce a summary at the end of each step for architect validation

**Don't**:
- Batch decision updates at the end of a step — decisions may be lost
- Silently modify previous entries — create a new reversal or superseding entry
- Omit rejected alternatives — they are critical for future design reviews
- Present agent recommendations as architect decisions — always attribute correctly
- Leave reversal chains unresolved — every reversed entry must link to its replacement
- Skip the mid-engagement summary — it catches missing or incorrect entries

If you propose changes, keep them minimal and clearly scoped.

## Gotchas

- ⚡ **Agent decisions attributed to architect**: The agent sometimes records its own recommendations as architect decisions. Always distinguish who drove each decision — misattribution corrupts the audit trail and can undermine trust during reviews.
- ⚡ **Missing rejected alternatives**: The agent tends to record only the selected option, omitting the alternatives that were considered and rejected. Rejected alternatives with reasons are critical for future design reviews — they prevent revisiting settled questions.
- ⚡ **Silent entry modification**: When context changes, the agent may update a previous decision entry in-place instead of creating a reversal or superseding entry. Never modify existing entries — always create a new entry that references and supersedes the original.

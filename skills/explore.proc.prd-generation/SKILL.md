# PRD Generation

Generate Product Requirements Documents using Signal-to-PRD bridge with 4-group approval workflow.

## Step Execution Rule
**ONE STEP AT A TIME**: Read step → Execute step → Complete step → Next step
❌ Reading ahead ❌ Multiple steps ❌ Skipping step files

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Convert validated Signals into Product Requirements Documents
- Document product requirements with structured stakeholder approval
- Create specification artifacts for implementation (Govern phase)
- Bridge discovery outputs into actionable requirements
- Ensure all assumptions are tracked as open questions

## Pre-Check

If a PRD already exists at `explore/prds/[slug]-prd.md`:
1. Load the existing PRD
2. Present to the steering team: "Existing PRD found. Review and update, or create fresh?"
3. If updating → load existing content and skip to Group 4 (Specification Completion) for review
4. If creating fresh → proceed from Step 1

## Inputs to Request (if missing)

Before generating a PRD, ensure you have:

1. **Signal document** — The validated Signal from Signal Agent
2. **Hypothesis** — Validated hypothesis from Discovery
3. **Technical feasibility notes** — From Step 2 technical feasibility assessment
4. **Personas** — From Persona skill
5. **Journey Maps** — From Journey Mapping skill
6. **Context baseline** — From Context Documentation skill
7. **Market research** — `explore/explore-[slug]/market-research.md` (competitive positioning, market gaps)
8. **Regulatory compliance** — `explore/explore-[slug]/regulatory-compliance.md` (compliance requirements as product constraints)
9. **Glossary** — `explore/glossary.md` (canonical terminology for requirements)
10. **Slug** — Project identifier (e.g., `care-it`)

**Optional inputs** (enhance quality if available):
- Refined concepts (`explore/explore-[slug]/ideation/[slug]-refined-concepts.md`) — if ideation ran, experience design direction and architecture implications
- HLD (`explore/hlds/[slug]-hld.md`) — if already produced, enriches Technical Notes
- Risk register (`explore/explore-[slug]/risks.md`) — if updating PRD after risk documentation, risk-driven requirement amendments

**STOP**: If any required inputs (1–10) are missing, ask the human to provide them before proceeding.

## Signal-to-PRD Bridge

| Signal Field | PRD Section | Transformation |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| The Signal | Problem Statement | 2–4 sentences; strip tags; preserve meaning |
| Initial Evidence | Background / Research | Linked sources; flag `[ASSUMPTION]` items as unverified |
| Why This Matters | Goals / Value Proposition | Validated hypothesis → goals |
| Actors identified | Target Users | Actor + persona need statement |
| Expected outcomes | Success Metrics | Measurable, testable acceptance criteria |
| Constraints identified | Constraints | Direct transfer; flag `[ASSUMPTION]`-tagged items |
| Technical feasibility | Technical Notes | Step 2 baseline + architecture discovery enrichment (if available); HLD summary added when HLD exists |
| Severity score (1–5) | Priority | 1–2 Low · 3 Medium · 4–5 High |
| Resonance score (1–5) | Stakeholder Appetite | 1–2 Low · 3 Moderate · 4–5 High |
| `[ASSUMPTION]` claims | Open Questions | Every assumption → prioritised open question |

## Output Format

```
explore/prds/[slug]-prd.md
```

**Slug-to-domain mapping**: The file name uses the slug (`[slug]-prd.md`), but the PRD title uses the domain name from the glossary (`PRD · [Domain Name]`). If slug ≠ domain name, the traceability header includes both `domain:` and `slug:` fields to maintain consistency.

**Template**: `templates/prd-template.md`

**Complete Structure**:
1. **Problem Statement** - User need and background
2. **Goals** - Measurable outcomes from hypothesis
3. **Success Metrics & KPIs** - Metrics table with targets
4. **Target Users** - From personas with need statements
5. **User Flows & Scenarios** - Primary, alternative, edge cases
6. **Functional Requirements** - Core and supporting features table
7. **Non-Functional Requirements** - Performance, security, reliability, usability
8. **Constraints** - Technical, business, regulatory, resource
9. **Out of Scope** - Explicitly excluded items
10. **Open Questions** - From assumptions, prioritised
11. **Technical Architecture** - Summary from HLD
12. **Risks & Mitigation** - From risk register
13. **Dependencies** - Upstream, downstream, external
14. **Epic Extraction** - Breakdown for implementation
15. **Approval & Sign-Off** - 4-role approval table

## Integration with Workflows

**Consumes**:
- **Context Documentation** — Problem statement and domain context
- **Hypothesis Documentation** — Validated hypothesis → goals and metrics
- **Persona** — Target users with need statements
- **Journey Mapping** — Pain points and opportunity moments → requirements
- **Market Research** — Competitive positioning and market gaps
- **Regulatory Compliance** — Compliance requirements as product constraints
- **Glossary** — Canonical terminology for requirement naming
- **Architecture Documentation** — HLD → technical architecture section (optional; enriches Technical Notes when available)
- **Risk Documentation** — Risk register → risks & mitigation (conditional: during PRD updates)

**Produces** (consumed by):
- **Information Architecture** (`explore.proc.information-architecture`) — Navigation requirements, page hierarchy
- **User Flow Creation** (`explore.proc.user-flow-creation`) — Requirements and user tasks define flow scope
- **Wireframing** (`explore.proc.wireframing`) — Requirements scope wireframe content
- **OOUX Analysis** (`explore.proc.ooux-analysis`) — Product description for object extraction
- **Hi-Fi Handoff** (`explore.proc.hifi-handoff`) — R-XXX requirement traceability
- **Risk Documentation** (`explore.proc.risk-documentation`) — Requirements analysis risks
- **Architecture Solutioning** (`explore.proc.architecture-solutioning`) — Requirements drive architecture
- **Test Strategy** (`explore.proc.test-strategy`) — Requirements to validate
- **Epic Forming** (`explore.proc.epic-forming`) — PRD → epic extraction for Govern phase

## Best Practices

**Do**:
- ✅ Use Signal-to-PRD bridge for consistent transformation
- ✅ Present each group for approval before proceeding
- ✅ Make success metrics measurable and time-bound
- ✅ Convert all [ASSUMPTION] items to open questions
- ✅ Link to all source artifacts (Signal, Hypothesis, HLD, etc.)
- ✅ Write acceptance criteria as testable statements
- ✅ Include both functional and non-functional requirements

**Don't**:
- ❌ Skip group-by-group approval workflow
- ❌ Leave assumptions untracked
- ❌ Write vague requirements without acceptance criteria
- ❌ Forget to link source artifacts
- ❌ Mix solution design into problem statement
- ❌ Skip non-functional requirements
- ❌ Proceed without all required inputs

## Completeness Checklist

**Post-edit**: Re-run this checklist after any modification to the output artifact.

- [ ] All 15 PRD sections populated per template
- [ ] Signal-to-PRD bridge applied for all mapped fields
- [ ] Every `[ASSUMPTION]` tag converted to an open question
- [ ] All 4 group gates (PRD-1 through PRD-4) passed
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable and time-bound
- [ ] Source artifacts linked (Signal, Hypothesis, Personas, Journeys)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable statements
- [ ] NFRs integrated alongside functional requirements

## Gotchas

- ⚡ **Requirements without acceptance criteria**: The agent tends to write requirements as narrative descriptions rather than testable statements. Every requirement must have at least one acceptance criterion — if you can't test it, it's not a requirement.
- ⚡ **Source artifact amnesia**: PRDs that don't link back to their source evidence (personas, journeys, hypotheses) become unverifiable. Always include explicit `[Source: ...]` references — a PRD requirement without provenance is an opinion.
- ⚡ **Non-functional requirements afterthought**: The agent frequently completes all functional requirements first, then adds NFRs as a thin appendix. NFRs (performance, security, accessibility) must be integrated alongside functional requirements — they shape the solution as much as features do.

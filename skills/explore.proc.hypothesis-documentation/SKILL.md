# Hypothesis Documentation

Document evidence-based hypotheses with validation tracking and measurable success criteria.

## Step Execution Rule
**ONE STEP AT A TIME**: Read step → Execute step → Complete step → Next step
❌ Reading ahead ❌ Multiple steps ❌ Skipping step files

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Draft hypotheses from discovery evidence
- Document evidence base and assumptions
- Track stakeholder validation
- Record hypothesis outcomes and validation status
- Bridge discovery insights to solution design

## Pre-Check

If hypothesis documentation already exists at `explore/explore-[slug]/hypotheses.md`:
1. Load the existing hypotheses
2. Present to the steering team: "Existing hypotheses found. Review and update, or create fresh?"
3. If updating → skip to the validation step with existing data for review
4. If creating fresh → proceed from Step 1

## Inputs to Request (if missing)

Before creating hypothesis documentation, ensure you have:

1. **Context baseline** — From Context Documentation skill
2. **Personas** — From Persona skill
3. **Journey maps** — From Journey Mapping skill
4. **Signal document** — "Why This Matters" section
5. **Market research** — `explore/explore-[slug]/market-research.md` (competitive gaps, white space)
6. **Domain analysis** — `explore/explore-[slug]/domain-analysis.md` (entity relationships, domain rules)
7. **Technical feasibility** — `explore/explore-[slug]/technical-feasibility.md` (technical constraints)
8. **Slug** — Project identifier for file naming (e.g., `care-it`)

**STOP**: If context, personas, or journey maps are missing, create them first. Market research, domain analysis, and technical feasibility are strongly recommended — hypotheses without these inputs lack competitive, domain, and technical grounding.

## Process Steps

| Step | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | [01-gather-evidence.md](./steps/01-gather-evidence.md) | Collect evidence from discovery artifacts |
| 2 | [02-draft-hypothesis.md](./steps/02-draft-hypothesis.md) | Draft hypothesis using standard format |
| 3 | [03-evidence-base.md](./steps/03-evidence-base.md) | Link hypothesis to discovery evidence |
| 4 | [04-identify-assumptions.md](./steps/04-identify-assumptions.md) | List assumptions embedded in hypothesis |
| 5 | [05-success-criteria.md](./steps/05-success-criteria.md) | Define measurable success criteria |
| 6 | [06-stakeholder-validation.md](./steps/06-stakeholder-validation.md) | Present hypothesis for stakeholder confirmation |
| 7 | [07-update-status.md](./steps/07-update-status.md) | Update status after stakeholder validation |
| 8 | [08-write-document.md](./steps/08-write-document.md) | Write hypothesis document |
| 9 | [09-validation.md](./steps/09-validation.md) | Run completeness validation |

## Output Format

```
explore/explore-[slug]/hypothesis.md
```

**Template**: `templates/hypothesis-template.md`

**Structure**:
- Hypothesis Statement
- Evidence Base (table with sources and validation status)
- Assumptions to Validate (table)
- Success Criteria (table with metrics and targets)
- Stakeholder Validation (record)
- Status, dates, and validation notes

## Integration with Workflows

**Consumes**:
- **Context Documentation** — Problem reframe, constraints, and assumptions feed hypothesis
- **Persona** — User needs articulation feeds hypothesis
- **Journey Mapping** — Pain points and opportunity moments feed hypothesis
- **Market Research** — Competitive gaps and white space feed hypothesis
- **Domain Analysis** — Entity relationships and domain rules feed hypothesis
- **Technical Feasibility** — Technical constraints feed hypothesis

**Produces** (consumed by):
- **Problem Framing** (Step 3 Phase A) — Validated direction frames ideation
- **Raw Ideas** (Step 3 Phase C) — Assumptions as divergence seeds
- **PRD Generation** (`explore.proc.prd-generation`) — Hypothesis outcomes become PRD goals

## Best Practices

**Do**:
- ✅ Use specific user/persona names, not generic "users"
- ✅ Base hypothesis on discovery evidence, not assumptions
- ✅ Make success criteria measurable and time-bound
- ✅ Identify and document all critical assumptions
- ✅ Get stakeholder validation before proceeding to design
- ✅ Link hypothesis to specific evidence sources
- ✅ Define what would invalidate the hypothesis

**Don't**:
- ❌ Create vague hypotheses without measurable outcomes
- ❌ Skip evidence documentation
- ❌ Assume all evidence is validated
- ❌ Forget to identify critical assumptions
- ❌ Proceed to design without stakeholder validation
- ❌ Make success criteria unmeasurable (e.g., "users will be happier")

## Completeness Checklist

**Post-edit**: Re-run this checklist after any modification to the output artifact.

- [ ] Every hypothesis is falsifiable with measurable criteria
- [ ] Evidence linked to each hypothesis (independent per hypothesis)
- [ ] Assumptions separated from validated facts with tags
- [ ] Success criteria are quantifiable and time-bound
- [ ] Invalidation criteria defined (what would disprove the hypothesis)
- [ ] Stakeholder validation obtained

## Gotchas

- ⚡ **Unfalsifiable hypotheses**: The agent tends to write hypotheses that can only be confirmed, not disproven (e.g., "Users may benefit from..."). Every hypothesis must be falsifiable — if no outcome could disprove it, it's not a hypothesis.
- ⚡ **Evidence laundering**: The agent sometimes cites the same piece of evidence across multiple hypotheses, making all of them appear well-supported. Each hypothesis should have independent evidence — shared evidence should be flagged as a single point of support.
- ⚡ **Assumption → validated creep**: Over time, `[ASSUMPTION]` tags tend to be silently upgraded to `[VALIDATED]` without actual validation occurring. Always require explicit validation evidence (date, method, source) before changing any tag.

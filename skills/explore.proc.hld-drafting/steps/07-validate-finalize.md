# Step 7: Validate and Finalize Draft

Run the validation checklist on the complete HLD.

**Validation checklist:**

- [ ] All 14 template sections present and complete
- [ ] System Overview clearly states architectural boundary and exclusions
- [ ] Architecture Approach pattern justified by current evidence
- [ ] Component Breakdown has non-overlapping responsibilities
- [ ] Integration & Data Flows cover all external and internal dependencies
- [ ] Key Decisions reference ADR files with decision + impact summaries
- [ ] Technology Stack distinguishes committed choices from TBD items
- [ ] Security covers auth, encryption, compliance, auditability, retention
- [ ] Scalability, Deployment, and Monitoring are proportionate to current evidence
- [ ] Open Questions have owners and target resolution dates
- [ ] Architecture rules enforced: bounded-context, input binding, event-driven, terminal states, layer separation, human flows, immutable corrections
- [ ] Abstraction rules enforced: no unjustified infrastructure, TBD items explicit
- [ ] Decision log updated with any new decisions from drafting
- [ ] Blocker register updated with any new blockers from drafting
- [ ] Enrichment Log and Document History are current
- [ ] File written to correct path with correct slug

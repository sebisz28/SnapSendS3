# Step 2: Assess Context via User Questions

## Objective

Ask targeted questions to clarify system scale, criticality, team maturity, platform constraints, and deployment expectations. These answers drive adaptive recommendations in subsequent steps — avoiding both over-engineering and under-engineering.

## Entry Criteria

- [ ] Step 1 complete with confirmed context profile
- [ ] Gaps identified where document context is insufficient

## Actions

### 2.1 Select Questions Based on Gaps

From the context profile, determine which questions are needed. **Do not ask questions already answered by PRD/HLD/ADRs**. Select only questions whose answers would materially change the strategy.

Maximum: **10 questions** per pass. Group by theme.

### 2.2 Core Question Set

**STOP — AskUserQuestion (present as numbered list, grouped by theme):**

**System Scale and Criticality**

```

  Question:    "How would you classify this system's criticality?"
  Multi-select: No
  Options:
    - Safety-critical          — Human safety depends on system correctness (medical, transport)
    - Business-critical        — Revenue or regulatory compliance depends on system availability
    - Standard commercial      — Important but downtime is tolerable for short periods
    - Internal / MVP           — Low risk; speed of learning matters more than reliability
```

```
Question DS-02
  Header:      "Expected deployment frequency"
  Question:    "How often do you expect to deploy to production?"
  Multi-select: No
  Options:
    - Multiple times per day   — Continuous delivery; trunk-based development
    - Daily to weekly          — Regular releases; short-lived feature branches

    - GCP                      — Google Cloud Platform
    - Not yet decided          — Strategy will remain cloud-agnostic for now
```

```

### 2.4 Derive Strategy Profile

Based on the assessment, determine the strategy profile that will guide all subsequent steps:

| Assessment | Low Complexity | Medium Complexity | High Complexity |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Criticality | Internal/MVP | Standard commercial | Business/Safety-critical |
| Frequency | Monthly+ | Weekly | Daily/Continuous |
| Scale | < 100 | 100-10,000 | 10,000+ |
| Maturity | Beginner | Developing/Mature | Advanced |
| Regulation | None | GDPR | FCA + GDPR + PCI |

**Strategy Profile**:
- **Lean** (low complexity) — Simple pipeline; minimal environments; basic observability; manual where acceptable
- **Standard** (medium complexity) — Full pipeline; 3-4 environments; automated security; SLOs defined
- **Enterprise** (high complexity) — Platform engineering; policy-as-code; progressive delivery; full observability; audit trails

Present the derived strategy profile to the human for confirmation.

# dava.flow

A Dava.Flow Context Warehouse.

> Agents: read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first. It is the authoritative root instruction for this warehouse; skills under `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` are authoritative within their domain.

## Overview

dava.flow coordinates warehouse operations, from incoming goods and inventory to order fulfillment and dispatch.

## Stack & Entry Points

<!-- PROJECT-SPECIFIC: Replace the TODO line with the primary language(s), frameworks, and canonical commands. -->
<!-- Example: "Go 1.24, Cobra CLI. Run `task test` / `task build`; validate config with `dft config check`." -->
_TODO: List the stack and the canonical commands for test / build / lint / format._

## Getting Started

1. Open this folder in your IDE and say **`Let's Flow`** (or `/flow` / `$flow`).
2. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for rules, boundaries, and `dft` usage.
3. Browse the phase directories for context: `signal/`, `explore/`, `govern/`, `evolve/`.

## Where Things Live

- `AGENTS.md` — root instruction for humans and agents.
- `.flow/` — Turbine configuration (`config.toml`, `skills.toml`).
- `skills/` — installed Flow Skills; each has a `SKILL.md`.
- `signal/`, `explore/`, `govern/`, `evolve/` — phase-aligned context.
- `work/` — active task workflow (managed by `dft task …`).

## Tooling

Managed by Turbine (`dft`). See **Tooling** in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full command surface and `Taskfile.yml` integration.

## Contributing

- Use `dft task …` to create and move tasks; manage skills with `dft skills …`. Never edit `work/` stages by hand.
- Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/); see **Commits & Branches** in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the change-type table.
